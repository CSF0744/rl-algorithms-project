## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd rl-algorithms-project
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the project, execute the `main.py` file:
```
python src/main.py
```

## Algorithms

This project includes implementations of various reinforcement learning algorithms, such as:
- DQN (Deep Q-Network)
- PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
- A3C (Asynchronous Actor-Critic)

## Environments

Custom environments can be defined or existing Gym environments can be wrapped for use with the algorithms.

## Testing

Unit tests for the algorithms are located in the `tests` directory. To run the tests, use:
```
pytest src/tests/test_algorithms.py
```
